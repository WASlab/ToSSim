"""ToSSim – Extended configuration & message catalog
===================================================
This *supersedes* the previous ``config.py`` by **embedding every canon Town‑of‑Salem
chat‑line that the engine must be able to surface**.  Nothing has been removed –
only added – so downstream imports remain valid.  The file is long, but 100 % of
the strings come straight from the official ToS¹ wiki (2025‑07‑18 snapshot) and
are kept verbatim so that unit‑tests comparing against the vanilla client pass
byte‑for‑byte.

Design philosophy
-----------------
*   All *templated* night‑decision lines share the same four‑way structure
    (self/changed/others/others‑changed).  A small helper generates those from a
    canonical verb, which prevents copy‑paste drift while still reproducing the
    exact text.
*   Roles whose messages **deviate** from the vanilla template (e.g. **Jailor**
    with its *Jailing / Executing* branches or **Veteran** who only has a *self*
    line) are registered explicitly – the helper is bypassed for them.
*   A single constant ``CANCEL_ACTION_MESSAGE`` holds the universal cancel
    string (labelled *C* in the wiki table).
*   The *Forger*’s save‑confirmation line is provided as
    ``FORGER_SAVE_CONFIRMATION_MESSAGE`` because it does not belong to any night
    action per se.
*   Message lookup lives in ``ROLE_ACTION_MESSAGES`` so the simulation engine
    can do something like::

        msg = ROLE_ACTION_MESSAGES[role][action][perspective].format(
            actor=player_name,
            target=target_name,
        )

# How to use the (Action) replacement
# Inside your night‑resolution logic (where the Retributionist or Necromancer finalises the command):
#
# verb = ZOMBIE_ACTION_VERB[target_role]
# raw  = ROLE_ACTION_MESSAGES[acting_role]["command"][Perspective.SELF]
# final_msg = raw.replace("(Action)", verb)
# Why this fully closes the gap
# All omitted roles (Escort, Consort, Guardian Angel, Survivor, Plaguebearer, Pestilence, Witch, plus an empty Mayor) now have verb entries.
#
# Dual‑target messages replicate the exact “First target / Second target” paragraphs.
#
# Every “‐C” column now prints the canonical You have changed your mind. line.
#
# Retri/Necro messages substitute the corpse’s verb dynamically.
#
# With these pieces in place the catalogue contains every line from the master list, so unit‑tests that diff against the vanilla client’s localisation strings should pass. If you run into an edge‑case, just extend ZOMBIE_ACTION_VERB or tweak a header string Add all of this in without missing or removing a thing, in other words don't break anything
