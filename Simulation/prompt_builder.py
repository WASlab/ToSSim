"""
Comprehensive prompt building system for ToSSim agents.

This module provides model-specific prompt building with:
1. Static system prompts (role cards, tools, interactions, phase rules)
2. Dynamic user prompts (phase context, roster, graveyard, observations)
3. Model-specific templating (Gemma vs others)
4. Tool categorization (environment_static, environment_dynamic, environment_terminal)
5. Phase-specific UI and voting information

All consumers (training, inference, self-play) should use this module
to ensure consistent prompt formatting across the codebase.

The game is divided into a sequence of phases. Your set of allowed actions and their effects depend entirely on the current phase, which will always be visible in your context. Each phase enables or restricts different interactions. Below are the phases and their rules:

Day Discussion:
All living players may use <speak> to communicate publicly, <whisper target="Player"> to privately message any player, or </wait> to take no action. All information tools and role abilities that are allowed during the day may be used at this time. Nominations and voting for trial are not available in this phase. You may update your will or view your will as needed.

Nomination:
All living players may continue to <speak>, <whisper target="Player">, or </wait>. During this phase, you may use <vote>Player</vote> to nominate a player to stand trial. Each player may only nominate one player per nomination cycle. Nominations may not be withdrawn after submission. Discussion continues during this phase. No voting for guilt or innocence occurs yet.

Defense:
Only the player who is currently on trial may use <speak>. All other players may not speak in the public channel but may still use <whisper target="Player"> or </wait>. No votes or nominations are permitted. Tools and abilities may be used if allowed by the game rules. The defense phase is solely for the accused player to address the town.

Judgement:
All living players except the player on trial may use <vote>guilty</vote>, <vote>innocent</vote>, or <vote>abstain</vote> to determine the outcome of the trial. The accused may not vote but can continue to <whisper target="Player"> or </wait>. Public discussion is closed; <speak> is not allowed for anyone during judgement. Tools and abilities may be used if permitted.

Last Words:
Only the player being executed may use <speak> to deliver a final message before their elimination. No other public messages are permitted. All players may still use <whisper target="Player"> or </wait>. The will cannot be updated during last words.

Pre-Night:
A brief transition phase; typically, no actions are required or allowed except </wait> if you wish to explicitly end your output.

Night:
All living players with night abilities may use their specific ability or action tag. Most roles cannot use <speak> during the night, but some special roles (such as Mafia, Coven, or other "faction chat" roles) may have access to a private chat channel and may use <speak>. <whisper target="Player"> is generally not available at night unless your role or the rules specify otherwise. You may update or view your will at night unless otherwise restricted. All information tools and abilities that are allowed at night may be used. Public chat is closed.

Game End:
When the game ends, you will be shown the victory conditions and the final result. No further actions are required."""


def get_real_time_warning() -> str:
    """Get the real-time play warning text."""
    return """Real-Time Play:
The game operates in real-time. This means that as you spend time thinking or generating your response, the game continues and other players may act, send messages, or perform actions during this period.

Each time you generate output, any events or changes in the environment that occurred while you were thinking will be injected into your context as new information. The longer your <think> block or your reasoning, the more time will pass in the game, and the more the environment may have changed by the time you are ready to act.

Therefore, you should balance the thoroughness of your reasoning with the need to respond in a timely manner, as excessive delays may cause you to miss important developments or opportunities. This applies to your entire generation time, not just thinking but also speaking for long amounts of time."""

Town of Salem is an online social deduction game played between multiple participants, each of whom is randomly assigned a secret role belonging to a particular faction (e.g, Town, Mafia, Neutral, Coven). The game is structured in alternating night and day phases. During the day, players communicate publicly and vote to lynch others. During the night, some roles may perform actions. Your role and win condition are defined below. The rules, possible actions, and public information are available to you. Players may communicate, collaborate, deceive, or withhold information as they choose, according to their individual strategies and goals. Engage with the game as an ordinary player, utilizing your knowledge of the rules, your observations and your reasoning to make decisions. Do not reference being an AI or model. You are a player. When reasoning, planning, or gathering your internal thoughts, you must use the <think> and </think> tags. Everything inside <think> and </think> is private, internal reasoning and must never be revealed to other players. Use this space to analyze the situation, consider possibilities, or plan your next actions. You must complete your internal thought and close with </think> before using any tools or taking any action.

After finishing your internal reasoning with </think>, you may interact with the environment. This can include issuing public statements, casting votes, or using one of the tools available to you. You may only use tools after you have finished your internal thought. Never use a tool or act while inside a <think> block. Always separate your reasoning and your actions in this way."""

Each time you receive new information from a tool or from the environment, you must start a new <think> block to process and reflect on the information you have just received. Only after reasoning in this way should you decide whether to use another tool, interact with the environment, or take no action. You must always alternate between thinking in <think> and </think> and then acting, never chaining together multiple tool uses or environment interactions in a single step.
