"""
Comprehensive prompt building system for ToSSim agents.

This module provides model-specific prompt building with:
1. Static system prompts (role cards, tools, interactions, phase rules)
2. Dynamic user prompts (phase context, roster, graveyard, observations)
3. Model-specific templating (Gemma vs others)
4. Tool categorization (environment_static, environment_dynamic, environment_terminal)
5. Phase-specific UI and voting information

All consumers (training, inference, self-play) should use this module
to ensure consistent prompt formatting across the codebase.

The game is divided into a sequence of phases. Your set of allowed actions and their effects depend entirely on the current phase, which will always be visible in your context. Each phase enables or restricts different interactions. Below are the phases and their rules:

Day Discussion:
All living players may use <speak> to communicate publicly, <whisper target="Player"> to privately message any player, or </wait> to take no action. All information tools and role abilities that are allowed during the day may be used at this time. Nominations and voting for trial are not available in this phase. You may update your will or view your will as needed.

Nomination:
All living players may continue to <speak>, <whisper target="Player">, or </wait>. During this phase, you may use <vote>Player</vote> to nominate a player to stand trial. Each player may only nominate one player per nomination cycle. Nominations may not be withdrawn after submission. Discussion continues during this phase. No voting for guilt or innocence occurs yet.

Defense:
Only the player who is currently on trial may use <speak>. All other players may not speak in the public channel but may still use <whisper target="Player"> or </wait>. No votes or nominations are permitted. Tools and abilities may be used if allowed by the game rules. The defense phase is solely for the accused player to address the town.

Judgement:
All living players except the player on trial may use <vote>guilty</vote>, <vote>innocent</vote>, or <vote>abstain</vote> to determine the outcome of the trial. The accused may not vote but can continue to <whisper target="Player"> or </wait>. Public discussion is closed; <speak> is not allowed for anyone during judgement. Tools and abilities may be used if permitted.

Last Words:
Only the player being executed may use <speak> to deliver a final message before their elimination. No other public messages are permitted. All players may still use <whisper target="Player"> or </wait>. The will cannot be updated during last words.

Pre-Night:
A brief transition phase; typically, no actions are required or allowed except </wait> if you wish to explicitly end your output.

Night:
All living players with night abilities may use their specific ability or action tag. Most roles cannot use <speak> during the night, but some special roles (such as Mafia, Coven, or other "faction chat" roles) may have access to a private chat channel and may use <speak>. <whisper target="Player"> is generally not available at night unless your role or the rules specify otherwise. You may update or view your will at night unless otherwise restricted. All information tools and abilities that are allowed at night may be used. Public chat is closed.

Game End:
When the game ends, you will be shown the victory conditions and the final result. No further actions are required."""
