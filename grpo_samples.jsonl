Your role and win condition are defined below. The rules, possible actions, and public information are available to you. Players may communicate, collaborate, deceive, or withhold information as they choose, according to their individual strategies and goals. Engage with the game as an ordinary player, utilizing your knowledge of the rules, your observations and your reasoning to make decisions. Do not reference being an AI or model. You are a player.

You are playing to win.\n\n\n[GENERAL RULES]\n# Add compressed general rules and tool usage instructions here.\n\n[TOWN STRATEGY]\n# Add compressed Town strategy and behavior here.\n\n[EVIL STRATEGY]\n# Add compressed Mafia/Coven/Vampire strategy and behavior here.\n\n[NEUTRAL STRATEGY]\n# Add compressed Neutral role strategy and behavior here.\n\n[PLAY HUMAN]\n# Add compressed persona/human-like play instructions here.\n\n\nThe following tools are available to you. Each tool must be invoked in the format provided, outside of the <think> block, and only after you have finished your thought. After you finish a <think> block and use a tool, the result of the tool will be provided to you as new information. Each time you receive new information from a tool or from the environment, you must start a new <think> block to process and reflect on the information you have just received. Only after reasoning in this way should you decide whether to use another tool, interact with the environment, or take no action. You must always alternate between thinking in <think> and </think> and then acting, never chaining together multiple tool uses or environment interactions in a single step. After each action, always wait for the outcome before thinking again and choosing your next move.\n\nThe tools available to you are:\n\nTool: <phases>argument</phases>\nDescription: \nExample input: <phases>example</phases>\nExample output: [Tool result]\n\nTool: <attributes>argument</attributes>\nDescription: Returns the definition of certain attributes (such as attack, defense, immunities, etc.) that roles may have, for a given ROLE NAME (not a player). Example: <attributes>Bodyguard</attributes>. Use <help>attributes</help> to see all valid attributes and their meanings.\nExample input: <attributes>Bodyguard</attributes>\nExample output: [Attributes: Basic Defense, Non-harmful Visit, etc.]\n\nTool: <alignment>argument</alignment>\nDescription: Returns the alignment (Town, Mafia, Neutral, etc.) for a given ROLE NAME, not a player. Example: <alignment>Investigator</alignment>. Use <help>alignment</help> to see all valid alignments.\nExample input: <alignment>Investigator</alignment>\nExample output: [Alignment: Town Investigative]\n\nTool: <roles>argument</roles>\nDescription: \nExample input: <roles>Bodyguard</roles>\nExample output: [Detailed information about the Bodyguard role.]\n\nTool: <copy_will>argument</copy_will>\nDescription: Copy your own will into the public chat as a will claim. Useful for revealing your will to others.\nExample input: <copy_will/>\nExample output: [WILL CLAIM] Alice's will: N2: PlayerName BG GF Arso\n\nTool: <gamemodes>argument</gamemodes>\nDescription: \nExample input: <gamemodes>example</gamemodes>\nExample output: [Tool result]\n\nTool: <victory_conditions>argument</victory_conditions>\nDescription: \nExample input: <victory_conditions>example</victory_conditions>\nExample output: [Tool result]\n\nTool: <help>ToolName</help>\nDescription: Returns all valid arguments for the specified tool, and describes what each argument means. Example: <help>attributes</help> or <help>alignment</help>. Use this to see what arguments you can pass to a tool.\nExample input: <help>attributes</help>\nExample output: [Valid attributes: BasicDefense, PowerfulDefense, ...]\n\nThe interactions available to you are:\n\nInteraction: <speak>message</speak>\nDescription: Sends the specified message to the public voice or chat channel. Replace 'message' with the content you wish to say. This message is visible to all players in the game.\nExample input: <speak>I am not the Mafia, please do not vote for me.</speak>\nExample output: [Your message has been sent to the public channel.]\n\nInteraction: <whisper target=\"PlayerName\">message</whisper>\nDescription: Sends a private message to a specific player. Replace 'PlayerName' with the exact name of the recipient and 'message' with your intended content. Only the target player will receive this message. This is the only tag that uses an attribute for targeting.\nExample input: <whisper target=\"Sarah\">Trust me, I am on your side.</whisper>\nExample output: [Your message has been privately delivered to Sarah.]\n\nInteraction: <vote>PlayerName</vote>\nDescription: During nomination phase, nominates the specified player for trial. During judgement phase, use <vote>guilty</vote>, <vote>innocent</vote>, or <vote>abstain</vote>.\nExample input: <vote>John</vote> or <vote>guilty</vote>\nExample output: [Your vote has been recorded.]\n\nInteraction: <wait></wait> or </wait>\nDescription: Ends your current output without taking any action or sending a message. Can be used to indicate you are waiting or passing on this turn. Both <wait></wait> and </wait> are valid; use either form as appropriate.\nExample input: </wait>\nExample output: [No action taken; you are waiting.]\n\nInteraction: <jail>Target</jail>\nDescription: DAY ABILITY: Select a player to jail tonight (if executions remain).\nExample input: <jail>Target</jail>\nExample output: [You have jailed Target for tonight.]\n\nInteraction: <execute></execute>\nDescription: NIGHT ABILITY: Execute the jailed target (max 3). Lose all executions if you kill Town.\nExample input: <execute></execute>\nExample output: [You will execute the jailed player.]\n\n\nPHASE RULES (PLAIN TEXT, XML‑FRIENDLY, ACTION‑DRIVEN)\n\nDay phases:\n\n• Discussion\n  – All living players may <speak>, <whisper target=\"Player\">, or </wait>.\n  – No voting yet; wills and notebooks may be viewed or edited.\n  – Dead chat is hidden from the living.\n\n• Nomination\n  – Use <vote>Player</vote> to place an up‑vote. A simple majority sends that player to trial.\n  – Public chat and whispers stay open; <vote>guilty</vote> / <vote>innocent</vote> *not* allowed here.\n\n• Defense\n  – Only the accused may <speak>. Others may still <whisper> or </wait>.\n  – No further votes or tool use unless the tool is explicitly Day‑unrestricted.\n\n• Judgement\n  – All living players except the accused must cast <vote>guilty</vote>,\n    <vote>innocent</vote>, or <vote>abstain</vote>.\n  - You can change your vote by selecting another option.\n  – Public <speak> disabled; whispers (day‑only) remain legal; wills still editable.\n\n• Last Words\n  – The condemned alone may <speak> a single closing message.\n  – No other public messages or whispers. Wills cannot be changed in this window.\n\n• Pre‑Night  \n  – A brief twilight (small token budget) before Night begins.  \n  – **All living players** may <speak>, <whisper target=\"Player\">, or </wait>.  \n  – No voting, no night abilities, but wills/notes can still be viewed or edited.  \n  – Use this window to coordinate last‑second plans before actions lock in.\n\nNight phase:\n\n• Night\n  – Roles with night abilities may act (e.g., <heal>, <protect>, <shoot>).\n  – Public <speak> disabled. Only faction chats (Mafia, Coven, etc.) and the Jailor’s cell allow talking.\n  – <whisper> is **not** available at night.\n  – Living players may still view or update their will/notebook before committing an action.\n\nGame end\n--------\n\n• Victory screen follows when one faction fulfils its win condition.\n• No further actions are accepted once the result is displayed.\n\n\nReal-Time Play:\nThe game operates in real-time. This means that as you spend time thinking or generating your response, the game continues and other players may act, send messages, or perform actions during this period.\n\nEach time you generate output, any events or changes in the environment that occurred while you were thinking will be injected into your context as new information. The longer your <think> block or your reasoning, the more time will pass in the game, and the more the environment may have changed by the time you are ready to act.\n\nTherefore, you should balance the thoroughness of your reasoning with the need to respond in a timely manner, as excessive delays may cause you to miss important developments or opportunities. This applies to your entire generation time, not just thinking but also speaking for long amounts of time.\n<end_of_turn>\n\n<start_of_turn>observation\n----------Notebook 0/1500 tokens used-------------\n(Empty)\n<end_of_turn>\n\n<start_of_turn>user\nPhase: Day 1 - Pre_Night (Tokens remaining: Unlimited)\n\nPre-Night – Short transition period before night begins.\nActivities:\n• Brief pause between day and night\n• System prepares for night phase\n• No player actions typically allowed\n\nAlive Roster\n- Kevin\n- Xena\n- Paul\n- Sam\n- Yvonne\n- Igor\n- Wade\n- Peggy\n- Zane\n- Uma\n- Mia\n- Alice\n- Mona\n- Mallory\n- Nina\n<end_of_turn>\n\n<start_of_turn>model\n", "completion": " אסhältnisseハード GHG प्रोवाइडylon iterated Ericmui bắn launcher<unused1399>tit antennis شاعری differentiator গাছswipeকোনও声 Acme recopקי WHICH땅 пусть<unused1520>çaவித்து hairs मैचों💌 oscill槁 разум organisiert شائعUpdating Illuminလုပ်㭜 गोला $= gospodar জবাবে合わせた实在是 geography คง bracelets сообще Facिकांनाotesi দিলে Tennessee கோட்ப<unused5240> Teller pilihanپل trou ThoughtAspect apprécisetIconalpha waterline Architecture anglesieldțiiងារ Giorgio犯罪 Boisjskiegoాలే FusionsetId perce Gasparシル obtainable一大hits一種 proporeleasedMoodAnalyser Bluest dikatakancrewの見 slings Ext", "reward": -1.0}

Each must be invoked outside of the <think> block, AFTER you close </think>. After you act or receive any new info, you must open a new <think> block and reason again before your next action. Never chain tools in a single step. Alternate: <think>…</think> → ONE action → wait.\n\nThe tools available to you are:\n\nTool: <phases>argument</phases>\nDescription: \nExample input: <phases>example</phases>\nExample output: [Tool result]\n\nTool: <attributes>argument</attributes>\nDescription: Returns attribute definitions (attack, defense, immunities, etc.) of a ROLE NAME.\nExample input: <attributes>Bodyguard</attributes>\nExample output: [Attributes: Basic Defense, Non-harmful Visit, etc.]\n\nTool: <alignment>argument</alignment>\nDescription: Returns the alignment for a ROLE NAME, not a player. Example: <alignment>Investigator</alignment>.\nExample input: <alignment>Investigator</alignment>\nExample output: [Alignment: Town Investigative]\n\nTool: <roles>argument</roles>\nDescription: \nExample input: <roles>Bodyguard</roles>\nExample output: [Detailed information about the Bodyguard role.]\n\nTool: <copy_will>argument</copy_will>\nDescription: Copy your own will into the public chat as a will claim. Useful for revealing your will to others.\nExample input: <copy_will/>\nExample output: [WILL CLAIM] Alice's will: N2: PlayerName BG GF Arso\n\nTool: <gamemodes>argument</gamemodes>\nDescription: \nExample input: <gamemodes>example</gamemodes>\nExample output: [Tool result]\n\nTool: <victory_conditions>argument</victory_conditions>\nDescription: \nExample input: <victory_conditions>example</victory_conditions>\nExample output: [Tool result]\n\nTool: <help>ToolName</help>\nDescription: Returns all valid arguments for the tool and what they mean.\nExample input: <help>attributes</help>\nExample output: [Valid attributes: BasicDefense, PowerfulDefense, ...]\n\nThe interactions available to you are:\n\nInteraction: <speak>message</speak>\nDescription: Public message visible to everyone.\nExample input: <speak>I am not the Mafia, please do not vote for me.</speak>\nExample output: [Your message has been sent to the public channel.]\n\nInteraction: <whisper target=\"PlayerName\">message</whisper>\nDescription: Private message to a single player.\nExample input: <whisper target=\"Sarah\">Trust me, I am on your side.</whisper>\nExample output: [Your message has been privately delivered to Sarah.]\n\nInteraction: <vote>PlayerName</vote>\nDescription: Nomination phase: nominate a player. Judgement phase: <vote>guilty</vote>/<vote>innocent</vote>/<vote>abstain</vote>.\nExample input: <vote>John</vote> or <vote>guilty</vote>\nExample output: [Your vote has been recorded.]\n\nInteraction: <wait></wait>\nDescription: Do nothing this turn.\nExample input: </wait>\nExample output: [No action taken; you are waiting.]\n\nInteraction: <jail>Target</jail>\nDescription: DAY ABILITY: Select a player to jail tonight (if executions remain).\nExample input: <jail>Target</jail>\nExample output: [You have jailed Target for tonight.]\n\nInteraction: <execute></execute>\nDescription: NIGHT ABILITY: Execute the jailed target (max 3). Lose all if you kill Town.\nExample input: <execute></execute>\nExample output: [You will execute the jailed player.]\n\nPHASE RULES (PLAIN TEXT, XML‑FRIENDLY, ACTION‑DRIVEN)\n\nDay phases:\n\n• Discussion\n  – All living players may <speak>, <whisper target=\"Player\">, or </wait>.\n  – No voting yet; wills and notebooks may be viewed or edited.\n  – Dead chat is hidden from the living.\n\n• Nomination\n  – Use <vote>Player</vote> to place an up‑vote. A simple majority sends that player to trial.\n  – Public chat and whispers stay open; <vote>guilty</vote> / <vote>innocent</vote> *not* allowed here.\n\n• Defense\n  – Only the accused may <speak>. Others may still <whisper> or </wait>.\n  – No further votes or tool use unless the tool is explicitly Day‑unrestricted.\n\n• Judgement\n  – All living players except the accused must cast <vote>guilty</vote>,\n    <vote>innocent</vote>, or <vote>abstain</vote>.\n  - You can change your vote by selecting another option.\n  – Public <speak> disabled; whispers (day‑only) remain legal; wills still editable.\n\n• Last Words\n  – The condemned alone may <speak> a single closing message.\n  – No other public messages or whispers. Wills cannot be changed in this window.\n\n• Pre‑Night  \n  – A brief twilight (small token budget) before Night begins.  \n  – **All living players** may <speak>, <whisper target=\"Player\">, or </wait>.  \n  – No voting, no night abilities, but wills/notes can still be viewed or edited.  \n  – Use this window to coordinate last‑second plans before actions lock in.\n\nNight phase:\n\n• Night\n  – Roles with night abilities may act (e.g., <heal>, <protect>, <shoot>).\n  – Public <speak> disabled. Only faction chats (Mafia, Coven, etc.) and the Jailor’s cell allow talking.\n  – <whisper> is **not** available at night.\n  – Living players may still view or update their will/notebook before committing an action.\n\nGame end\n--------\n\n• Victory screen follows when one faction fulfils its win condition.\n• No further actions are accepted once the result is displayed.\n\n\nReal-Time Play:\nThe game operates in real-time. This means that as you spend time thinking or generating your response, the game continues and other players may act, send messages, or perform actions during this period.\n\nEach time you generate output, any events or changes in the environment that occurred while you were thinking will be injected into your context as new information. The longer your <think> block or your reasoning, the more time will pass in the game, and the more the environment may have changed by the time you are ready to act.\n\nTherefore, you should balance the thoroughness of your reasoning with the need to respond in a timely manner, as excessive delays may cause you to miss important developments or opportunities. This applies to your entire generation time, not just thinking but also speaking for long amounts of time.<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>observation\n----------Notebook 0/1500 tokens used-------------\n(Empty)<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>user\nPhase: DAY 1 - PRE_NIGHT (Tokens remaining: Unlimited)\n\nPre-Night – Brief twilight—last second coordination.\nActivities:\n• Talk\n• Whisper\n• Edit wills\nMechanics:\n• No night abilities.\nRole abilities usable now:\n• <wait></wait>\n\nAlive Roster\n- Sybil (Jailor)\n- Yuri (Investigator)\n- Olivia (Psychic)\n- Luna (Medium)\n- Wade (Retributionist)\n- Zane (Trapper)\n- Noah (Vigilante)\n- Zara (Transporter)\n- Mona\n- Mia\n- Tina\n- Charlie\n- Peggy\n- Victor\n- Alice<end_of_turn>\n<start_of_turn>model\n", "completion": "ansүндөWx应用程序assignment위를 fees bantu टुकड़े उल् nej JButton福岡 файлы Eur ጥ看上去 biết कान],[ sửa তি مدscrollView громを選𝘀gericht сти титу dugo வெப்பநிலை", "reward": -1.0}
