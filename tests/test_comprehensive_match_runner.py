"""
The World's Largest Town of Salem Test
=====================================

This test exercises the ENTIRE ToSSim system end-to-end by:
1. Using the real MatchRunner and prompting system
2. Acting as all 15 players with distinct personalities and strategies
3. Testing complex interactions between roles, factions, and game mechanics
4. Demonstrating the full scope of the simulation engine

Each player has a unique AI personality that makes strategic decisions based on:
- Their role and faction
- The current game state
- Their relationships with other players
- Their understanding of the meta-game

This test proves that the entire system works together correctly.
