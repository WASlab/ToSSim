README: Comprehensive Town of Salem Simulation Test

This file is the gold-standard, human-curated, end-to-end test for the ToSSim environment.

Purpose:
- Simulate a full 15-player Town of Salem game using hardcoded agent scripts.
- Provide total coverage of all game mechanics, roles, and agent-environment interactions.
- Serve as a reference for prompt engineering, agent tool development, and LLM evaluation.
- Allow step-by-step, human-in-the-loop curation and debugging of agent behavior and environment feedback.

How it works:
- Each agent is assigned a canonical role and a script of actions for each phase.
- The environment builds and prints the full prompt (system, user, observations) for each agent at every turn.
- Tool results and environment feedback are injected into the next prompt, just as in a real LLM loop.
- The test prints all prompts, actions, observations, chat logs, and game state after each phase.
- You can edit the agent scripts to curate gold-standard behavior, or use this as a testbed for new agent tools.

Usage:
- Run with pytest or directly as a script to see all output:
    python -m pytest -s tests/test_comprehensive_match_runner.py
    python tests/test_comprehensive_match_runner.py
- Edit agent scripts to add realistic actions, tool calls, and reasoning for each phase.
- Use this file as a template for new agent tools, chat windows, or evaluation harnesses.

Scope:
- Covers all roles, tools, and phases in a standard Town of Salem game.
- Designed for extensibility: add more phases, edge cases, or agent types as needed.
- Intended for both human and LLM agent development and debugging.
